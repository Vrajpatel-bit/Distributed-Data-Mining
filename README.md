# Assessing survey on Distributed Data Mining

Due to the rapid growth of resource sharing, distributed
systems are developed, which can be used to utilize the
computations. Data mining (DM) provides powerful techniques
for finding meaningful and useful information from a very
large amount of data, and has a wide range of real-world
applications. However, traditional DM algorithms assume that
the data is centrally collected, memory-resident, and static. It is
challenging to manage the large-scale data and process them
with very limited resources. For example, large amounts of
data are quickly produced and stored at multiple locations. It
becomes increasingly expensive to centralize them in a single
place. Moreover, traditional DM algorithms generally have some
problems and challenges, such as memory limits, low processing
ability, and inadequate hard disk, and so on. To solve the
above problems, distributed computing environment [also called
distributed data mining (DDM)] has been emerging as a valuable
alternative in many applications. In this study, a survey of stateof-
the-art DDM techniques is provided, including distributed
frequent itemset mining, distributed frequent sequence mining,
distributed frequent graph mining, distributed clustering, and
privacy preserving of distributed data mining.

## Usage

Usage of the project is, checking which neural network gives more accuracy, and better and accurate results.
Below there is images of the accuracy for the different models:

1) Convolution Neural Network:

## Roadmap

- Make custom dataset and perform experiments on it

- Improve Model accuracy and I will used different models.

- I will look forward to build GUI for this project

  
## Acknowledgements

-First of all, I want to thank Dr. Trevor Tomesh for providing me with this great opportunity. For those who have experience in this field has added their knowledge to my exploratory analysis and provided valuable cooperation and insights, as well as guidance and technical information. I am very happy to recognize the role of people directly or indirectly involved in the development of this project. This project gave me an experience, greatly helped and encouraged me to develop my professional knowledge and complete this research within the specified time.

  
## Project Status

So, this project is not completed yet, there are some modifications also needed, and I will try to implement GUI for this project. And also, implement different models for this to get better accuracies for the real-time experiments.
