# Assessing survey on Distributed Data Mining

Due to the rapid growth of resource sharing, distributed
systems are developed, which can be used to utilize the
computations. Data mining (DM) provides powerful techniques
for finding meaningful and useful information from a very
large amount of data, and has a wide range of real-world
applications. However, traditional DM algorithms assume that
the data is centrally collected, memory-resident, and static. It is
challenging to manage the large-scale data and process them
with very limited resources. For example, large amounts of
data are quickly produced and stored at multiple locations. It
becomes increasingly expensive to centralize them in a single
place. Moreover, traditional DM algorithms generally have some
problems and challenges, such as memory limits, low processing
ability, and inadequate hard disk, and so on. To solve the
above problems, distributed computing environment [also called
distributed data mining (DDM)] has been emerging as a valuable
alternative in many applications. In this study, a survey of stateof-
the-art DDM techniques is provided, including distributed
frequent itemset mining, distributed frequent sequence mining,
distributed frequent graph mining, distributed clustering, and
privacy preserving of distributed data mining.

## Usage

can be used to utilize the computations. Data mining (DM) provides powerful techniques for finding meaningful and useful information from a very large amount of data, and has a wide range of real-world applications where data mining has benefited most of the companies with products need to sell or not; medical researchers use the facts that are helpful with vaccines required to develop by analyzing recent disease patterns; assist engineers with highways need to be build & much more.
Therefore, it is important to develop a more adaptable and flexible mining framework to discover hidden but useful and meaningful patterns, and information from the distributed and complex databases instead of the centralized ones. To solve these problems, DM on distributed environments [also called distributed data mining (DDM)] has emerged as an important research area. In the DDM literature, one of the two assumptions is commonly adopted as to how data is distributed across sites: homogeneously (horizontally partitioned) and heterogeneously (vertically partitioned). In general, DDM deals with some challenges for analyzing distributed data and offers many algorithmic solutions to perform different data analysis and mining operations in a fundamentally distributed manner, which pays very careful attention to resource constraints.

1) Distributed Meta-Learning: 
   Meta-learning is a technique that seeks to compute higher-level classiﬁers (or classiﬁcation models), called meta-classiﬁers, that integrate in some principled fashion multiple classiﬁers computed separately over different databases. This study, describes meta-learning and presents the JAM system (Java Agents for Meta-learning), an agent-based meta-learning system for large scale datamining applications. Speciﬁcally, it identiﬁes and addresses several important describe data for distributed data mining systems that stem from their additional complexity compared to centralized or host based systems. 

2) Distributed Frequent Itemset Mining:
   FIM (Frequent Item Set Mining) is one of the core of the data mining field. Existing frequent pattern mining is primarily based on static databases. But most data in the real world is uncertain. Frequent pattern mining has been extensively studied based on uncertain data. Existing algorithms generally fall into three categories. Some are based on predictive support models, some are based on stochastic support models, and others are based on weighted frequency pattern mining models

3) Distributed Association Rule Mining:
   DARM refers to the mining of association rules from distributed datasets. The datasets are stored in local databases hosted by local computers which are connected through a computer network. Typical DARM algorithm involves local data analysis from which a global knowledge can be extracted using knowledge integration techniques.
DARM algorithms must reduce  communication costs so that generating global association rules costs less than combining the participating sites' data sets into a centralized site. 
In this there are three alternative algorithms, we can perform this on the large item datasets and they all are efficient as per data collection and representation. There are certain rules to perform these algorithms; it's like optimization before preprocessing and analysis after prediction.
